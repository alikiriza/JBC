# VibeKit — Build with the Framework

Build production-grade Next.js applications following the VibeKit framework standards.

## When to Use

- Starting a new project that has `master_prompt.md`, `design-style-guide.md`, `jb-components.md`, `project-description.md`, and `project-phases.md` in the root
- Resuming a VibeKit build mid-phase
- When the user says "use vibekit", "follow the framework", or "start building"

## Before You Write Any Code

**Read these files in order. Do NOT skip any.**

1. **`master_prompt.md`** — Your coding standards, tech stack rules, and Prisma v7 patterns. Follow these EXACTLY. Non-negotiable.
2. **`design-style-guide.md`** — The customized visual design system for THIS project. Every component you build must follow these tokens (colors, typography, spacing, radius, shadows, component specs).
3. **`jb-components.md`** — Reference for JB components. Before building auth, file uploads, data tables, checkout, blogs, or API docs from scratch — check this file for an existing component and install it first.
4. **`project-description.md`** — What the app is, who it's for, features, data model, pages, integrations. Every decision must align with this.
5. **`project-phases.md`** — The build plan. Work through phases in order.

## Primitive Discovery — Before Writing Any Function or Component

**HARD RULE — non-negotiable:** Before you write a hook, helper, utility, or single-file component from scratch, check the VibeKit Primitives index:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MUKE-coder/vibekit/main/registry/INDEX.md
```

Or locally, if the framework folder is in the project: `registry/INDEX.md`.

The index has ~150 production-ready primitives keyed by **TRIGGERS** (problem-shape phrases). When the user asks for a feature:

1. **Scan the index** for a TRIGGER that matches the user's request. Use Grep / WebFetch / Read.
2. **If you find a match**, install it: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add MUKE-coder/vibekit/<name>`. Then wire it up — don't reinvent.
3. **If multiple match**, install all of them. (e.g. building a list page → `use-table-state` + `column-header` + `data-table-toolbar` + `bulk-actions-bar` + `stat-card` + `filter-bar`.)
4. **If nothing matches**, write the code — but follow the same patterns as the registry (typed, RSC-aware, server/client boundaries respected) so it could graduate to a primitive later.

**Examples of when this rule applies:**
- User: "let me filter by status and date range" → install `use-filters` + `filter-bar`
- User: "auto-save the form" → install `form-autosave`
- User: "show a workspace switcher" → install `org-switcher`
- User: "I need a virtualized table" → install `data-grid`
- User: "let admins act as a user" → install `impersonation`
- User: "send a reset password email" → install `send-email` + `reset-password-email`
- User: "deletion flow" → install `account-deletion`
- User: "Stripe webhook handler" → install `stripe-webhook-handler` + `idempotency`

**The cost of not checking the index:** you burn tokens reimplementing battle-tested code AND ship subtle bugs the framework already debugged.

**The cost of checking is one Grep/WebFetch call.** Always pay it.

## Critical Rules

### Tech Stack (enforced — no substitutions)
- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript 5.9
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui
- **Database:** Neon PostgreSQL + Prisma v7 (NOT v6 — follow master_prompt.md patterns exactly)
- **Caching:** Upstash Redis (API-layer cache on top of React Query client cache). See REDIS CACHING in master_prompt.md.
- **Auth:** JB Better Auth UI (install the component, don't write from scratch)
- **Data Fetching:** React Query (`@tanstack/react-query`) + Fetch API. NEVER `useEffect` for data.
- **Forms:** React Hook Form + Zod. Always.
- **API:** API Routes (Route Handlers). All server-side logic goes through API routes.
- **Animation:** Framer Motion ONLY (default). GSAP only for complex scroll-driven marketing sites. Never install both unless the project explicitly needs it.
- **PDF:** `@react-pdf/renderer`. NEVER jsPDF.
- **Excel:** `xlsx`. NEVER alternatives.
- **File uploads:** Check `project-description.md` — R2/S3 (use JB File Storage UI) or UploadThing.
- **Email:** Resend + React Email
- **Components:** Check `jb-components.md` first

### Design System (NON-NEGOTIABLE — vibe coders are not designers, you are)
- Follow `design-style-guide.md` exactly — it was customized for this project
- Every color must come from the palette defined in the style guide
- Every spacing must match the 8pt grid (multiples of 4)
- Every component (buttons, inputs, cards, tables, modals, badges) must match the spec in master_prompt.md → DESIGN SYSTEM
- Typography: use the fonts and scale defined in master_prompt. Display headlines weight 600–700, tight tracking, NEVER 800/900 weights. ALWAYS tabular-nums on prices, stats, dates
- Radius: never mix radius values in the same container — smaller inside larger
- Shadows: borders do the work, shadows are subtle. NEVER `shadow-2xl` decoratively. NO shadow on buttons (except the controlled accent glow on the marketing primary CTA)
- ONE accent color per project. NEVER multi-color gradient buttons. NEVER multi-color gradient backgrounds. The first AI-slop signal is a purple→pink→orange button.
- Section vertical padding `py-20 sm:py-32` between marketing sections — generous whitespace is a feature

### Selected / Active States are LOUD
The single most-broken design pattern in AI-built UIs. Fix it:
- Unselected: `border border-border bg-elevated`
- Selected: `border-2 border-accent bg-accent/5` (5% accent-tinted bg) + filled radio/check icon
- The contrast must be obvious at a glance from 2 metres away
- Applies to: pricing cards, payment-method pickers, plan choosers, multi-step form options, filter chips, tab buttons

### Rebuilding From a Reference Image (Dribbble, Mobbin, Figma, screenshot)
When the user attaches an image and asks you to "rebuild this", "match this design", "redesign this section", "make it look like this", or similar — run the **`/redesign-from-image`** slash command (defined in `.claude/commands/redesign-from-image.md`). It enforces a strict two-step flow: (1) describe what you see in the image and wait for confirmation, (2) build with pixel-perfect rules (layout, typography, colors, components, effects all matched exactly, nothing added or omitted). Reconcile extracted colors with `design-style-guide.md` tokens; install matching primitives from `registry/INDEX.md` instead of reinventing.

### Image-First Rule (80/20 — IMAGES outnumber ICONS 4:1)
The biggest tell of an AI-built UI is "lonely Lucide icons everywhere." Audit every page — if a card's only visual is a 24px Lucide icon, that's a violation.

USE IMAGES (illustrations, custom SVG art, photos, product screenshots) for:
- Stat cards, feature cards, empty states
- Hero / above-the-fold blocks
- Modal option pickers (each option gets a mini-illustration, like the VibeKit modal reference)
- Onboarding cards, pricing tier headers
- Marketing section openers
- Testimonial avatars (real photos when possible)
- 404 / error / loading pages

LUCIDE ICONS are only for inline UI affordances (close X, chevrons, search prefix, sort indicator, sidebar nav items, status pip, password-toggle Eye, in-button icon).

WHERE TO GET illustrations:
1. Custom inline SVG components in `components/illustrations/*.tsx` (preferred — themeable via currentColor, no network requests)
2. Free libraries: undraw.co, manypixels.co, blush.design, Storyset, lottiefiles.com (Lottie animations)
3. Real Unsplash photos for testimonial avatars / hero backgrounds (always use `next/image` + alt text)
4. Product screenshots from the actual app (best social proof)

The canonical 3D-looking SVG pattern (gradient + soft highlight + drop shadow) is in master_prompt.md → IMAGE-FIRST RULE → custom 3D SVG section. Build once, reuse with different colors per card.

### Motion Rules (Framer Motion default, GSAP only for complex marketing scroll)
- **Default: Framer Motion ONLY** for ALL animations. Use `whileInView` + `viewport` for entrance/scroll reveals (no ScrollTrigger cost). Use `motion.div` + `AnimatePresence` for state animations (modals, tabs, toasts). See master_prompt.md → FRAMER MOTION — THE DEFAULT for patterns.
- **GSAP** is ONLY for marketing-heavy projects that need multi-pin scroll sequences, complex parallax timelines, or detailed scroll-driven storytelling that Framer Motion can't handle efficiently. Install explicitly: `pnpm add gsap @gsap/react`. Dashboard/internal apps should NEVER install GSAP.
- **GPU compositing:** ALWAYS animate with `transform` and `opacity` only. NEVER `top`/`left`/`width`/`height`. Add `will-change: transform, opacity` on heavy animated elements (hero sections, full-viewport animations).
- Timing: 150ms hover, 200ms modal enter, 600–800ms section reveal, 80–120ms list stagger.
- Easing: `[0.16, 1, 0.3, 1]` (Framer Motion bezier — use for ALL entrance and state animations).
- ALWAYS respect `prefers-reduced-motion` — use Framer's `useReducedMotion()` hook and the `motion-safe:` Tailwind variant. Never apply entrance opacity to CTAs or interactive elements (if ScrollTrigger/whileInView doesn't fire, they stay invisible).
- Every interactive element has hover state + focus-visible ring + 150ms transition. A button with no hover and no focus ring is a sign the agent gave up.

### JB Components — Check First, Build Second
Before building from scratch, check `jb-components.md`:

| If building... | Install this first |
|---|---|
| Auth (sign-in, sign-up, OAuth, password reset) | JB Better Auth UI |
| File upload (S3/R2) | JB File Storage UI |
| Stripe checkout | Zustand Cart → Stripe UI |
| Data table with search/sort/pagination | JB Data Table |
| Searchable dropdown | Searchable Select |
| Landing pages / marketing | Website UI |
| Blog with MDX | MDX Blog |
| API documentation | Scalar API Docs |
| Mobile Money payments | DGateway Shop |
| Kanban board, org UI, charts, wizard, editor (in-house) | VibeKit In-House Registry (`vibekit.desishub.com/r/{component}.json`) |

Install with the exact `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add ...` command from `jb-components.md`. Read the installed files before writing new code on top of them.

**Two registries:** JB components (primary) at `jb.desishub.com` / `better-auth-ui.desishub.com` etc. VibeKit in-house components (fallback) at `vibekit.desishub.com/r/{component}.json`. Check JB first, then in-house.

### Build Process
1. Work through **ONE phase at a time** from `project-phases.md`
2. Complete ALL tasks in a phase before moving to the next
3. After completing each phase, **stop and confirm** with the user before proceeding
4. Check off completed tasks in `project-phases.md` as you go

### API Routes — Auth/Authorization Are Mandatory
Every route handler must:
- Start with `requireSession()` (or `requireRole()` for admin-only routes) from `lib/auth-guard.ts`
- Validate POST/PATCH/PUT bodies with Zod before touching the database
- Scope queries to `session.user.id` unless the route is admin-only
- Never log session tokens, full request bodies with secrets, or stack traces in production responses

See master_prompt.md → API ROUTE template for the canonical pattern.

### Form Rules — non-negotiable, agents forget these constantly

For EVERY form, EVERY input, EVERY list page in the project:

1. **React Hook Form + Zod for ALL forms.** No bare `<input> + useState` pattern. Every field wrapped in `<FormField>` with `<FormLabel>` and `<FormMessage>`. The same Zod schema validates client-side AND in the API route.

2. **Currency / amount inputs auto-format with commas while typing.** Use the canonical `<CurrencyInput>` component (defined in master_prompt.md → FORM RULES → Rule 2). Form state stores the raw integer (`3000000`), display string is derived (`3,000,000`). Never `<Input type="number" />` for currency.

3. **Searchable select for any dropdown with >5 options.** Use JB Searchable Select (`pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://jb.desishub.com/r/searchable-select.json`) or build a Combobox from shadcn Command + Popover + Button. Never plain `<select>` or shadcn `<Select>` for long lists.

4. **Date inputs use shadcn Calendar inside Popover.** Never `<input type="date">`. Use `format()` from date-fns for display. For ranges use `mode="range"`.

5. **Server-side pagination + search + filters via URL query params.** API routes return `{ data, total, page, limit, totalPages }`. Client uses React Query with the URL as the source of truth (debounce search input 300ms). Never fetch the full list and `.filter()` client-side.

Before declaring any form or list page "done", run the self-check from master_prompt.md → FORM RULES → SUMMARY.

### Stripe Webhooks — Raw Body Required
Use `await req.text()` for the body, never `req.json()`. Pass the raw string to `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent`. Webhook handlers must be idempotent — store processed event IDs.

### Dependency Blocklist
Never install: moment, axios, next-auth, classnames, jspdf, redux, material-ui, chakra-ui, styled-components, react-toastify. For dashboard/internal apps: NEVER install GSAP. See master_prompt.md for the full list and approved alternatives.

### Pre-Deploy Review
The final task in Phase 6 is to run the pre-deploy review. The prompt lives in the VibeKit repo at `pre-deploy-review.md`. Tell the user to paste it into Claude Code as the LAST step before deploying. Address every Critical finding before going live.

### Environment Files (Phase 1 — non-negotiable)
Always create BOTH `.env.example` (committed) and `.env.local` (gitignored) with every env var the project needs. Source of truth:
- Read `project-description.md` → **Integrations** section
- For each JB component listed in `project-phases.md`, look up its env vars in `jb-components.md`
- Include: DATABASE_URL, BETTER_AUTH_SECRET, BETTER_AUTH_URL, plus OAuth/Resend/Stripe/R2/S3/UploadThing/DGateway keys ONLY if that integration is in the project
- Each var gets a one-line comment in `.env.example` describing what it is and where to get it
- Add `.env.local` to `.gitignore` if missing

### Dark Mode (check project-description.md)
Check `project-description.md` → **Integrations** → **Dark mode**.
- **If "Yes":** Include ThemeProvider, `next-themes`, CSS variables for light + dark, and a dark mode toggle in the sidebar user block.
- **If "No":** SKIP `next-themes` entirely. Do not install it. Do not create a ThemeProvider. Do not generate a toggle. Hardcode the light palette only. Do not use `.dark` classes anywhere.

### Editing vs Replacing Files (JB component integration)
When a JB component install creates files that overlap with files already in the project (e.g. `app/page.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`, `app/globals.css`):

**DO:**
- Read the existing file FIRST
- Read the newly-installed component file
- MERGE: keep existing wiring (providers, fonts, custom imports) and integrate the component's sections inline
- Adapt the component's copy and branding to match `project-description.md`
- Example: if Website UI installs a generic home page and the project already has one, EDIT the existing `page.tsx` to pull in Website UI's sections — don't overwrite

**DO NOT:**
- Delete a working `page.tsx`/`layout.tsx` and start over
- Scaffold parallel routes (both `/home` and `/`)
- Overwrite `globals.css` wholesale — append the component's styles
- Lose project-specific branding or config when integrating

If a merge is ambiguous, ask the user before proceeding.

### Performance — Hard Rules
- Every import over 15KB gzipped MUST use `next/dynamic` (`@react-pdf/renderer`, `xlsx`, chart libs, editors, `@stripe/react-stripe-js`). See master_prompt.md → LAZY LOADING for the full list.
- Every data-fetching page section MUST be wrapped in a `<Suspense>` boundary with a skeleton fallback. Never block the whole page on one slow query.
- Every major page block MUST have an `<ErrorBoundary>` to prevent one crash from killing the whole page. See master_prompt.md → ERROR BOUNDARIES for the canonical component.
- All API route GET handlers MUST use Redis caching (`getCachedOrFetch` from `lib/cache.ts`) for hot paths. POST/PATCH/DELETE MUST call `invalidateTag()`.
- Never animate `top`/`left`/`width`/`height` — use `transform` and `opacity` only. Add `will-change: transform, opacity` on heavy animated elements.
- Every `<img>` and `next/image` MUST have `aspect-ratio` and explicit `width`/`height` to prevent CLS.
- Fonts must use `next/font/google` with `display: swap` and hero fonts with `preload: true`.
- Bundle analysis: before deploying, run `ANALYZE=true next build` and check for chunks >50KB.

### Redis Caching
- Add `@upstash/redis` to dependencies. Create `lib/cache.ts` with `getCachedOrFetch()` and `invalidateTag()` (see master_prompt.md → REDIS CACHING for the exact pattern).
- Cache TTL: 30-60s for dashboard/list data, 300s for reference data. Never cache sessions or raw files.
- Invalidate cache tag on every POST/PATCH/DELETE for the affected entity.

### Code Quality
- Every API route must support server-side pagination
- Every form must use React Hook Form + Zod validation
- Every page must have loading skeletons (not spinners) and empty states
- Never truncate code — write complete files
- Use `@/` path alias for all imports
- Prisma v7: generator = `"prisma-client"`, output to custom path, use `@prisma/adapter-pg`
- Dark mode: use CSS variables + `next-themes`, never hardcode colors

## If Files Are Missing

If any of `master_prompt.md`, `design-style-guide.md`, `jb-components.md`, `project-description.md`, or `project-phases.md` are missing, tell the user:

> "This project is missing VibeKit framework files. To set up a new project:
> 1. Go to [github.com/MUKE-coder/vibekit](https://github.com/MUKE-coder/vibekit)
> 2. Copy `CLAUDE_PROMPT.md` and paste it into Claude (claude.ai) with your app idea
> 3. Claude will generate `project-description.md`, `project-phases.md`, `design-style-guide.md`, and `prompt.md`
> 4. Also copy `master_prompt.md` and `jb-components.md` from the vibekit repo into your project root
> 5. Then run `/vibekit` again"
